### What I learned

* Fair understanding of **CSS grid** and **flexbox**.
* Improved **code structure** and **code readability**.
* Improved **clean code** writing.
* Comfort use of browser's **developer tools**.

* A lot of minor things.

### What could be improved

* I feel that commits were not regular enough.
* My commit messages are not perfect.
* It's not responsive, but there was no such requirment so I didn't make it.
* Some things was changed in google while I was making a website so it's not perfect with up to date Google:
  * google added some new content (videos suggestions, extra content for results, etc...);
  * constantly changing URL line (favicons, colors, position);
  * for sure will change something in the future.
